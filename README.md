GNL is a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

This project introduces a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.
It also gives a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the
stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the
unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.
